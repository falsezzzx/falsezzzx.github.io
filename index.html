<h1>Freemind:</h1>
<p>Have you ever just not done an assignment either due to not remembering or because “I can just turn it in late”? Ever been late to a class or appointment from just leaving too late? Freemind is here to help. 
Freemind is a smart-watch app meant to help motivate you to complete the tasks you find necessary for yourself. Set your tasks, upload a photo as proof the task was completed, and find yourself earning points towards rewards! Your points can earn you gift cards and other items! Freemind will remind you up to three times about your task. 
I personally find myself struggling to motivate myself to do tasks that I know I should, whether it’s homework or some other tasks such as staying active or cooking. I think a program that better reminds and motivates people to perform tasks would help people such as myself. I think many other students either in high school or college would benefit from something like this, but I can see many types of people using Freemind. I also have attempted to participate in websites like Microsoft rewards or Fetch rewards in order to get some kind of monetary value out of my free time, but find myself forgetting they exist. Combining a task reminder app with a rewards system feels like a good match.
The problem is societal, in that some people are accidentally unreliable due to being unable to motivate ourselves to perform a task. Another part of the issue is people not being able to make themselves do something that would benefit them greatly.
A program like this would need someone able to program for smart watches and someone who knows how to work with the servers to keep a user’s points and rewards together. It may also need sponsors or something to actually earn the gift cards and such.
Freemind will solve these issues by reminding you more aggressively than smartphone versions of similar apps. I think that while there are numerous apps like this on mobile, they run into an issue of not being “aggressive” enough with their reminders and rewards. You must open the app on your phone to update it each time, while I think an app like this would work better as a smart watch type app. The main components would be a timeline where you can see your upcoming tasks, a rewards section similar to different types of survey apps where the user can trade points in for various gift cards, and other items, and an editing section where you can update your tasks. The watch would vibrate and pop-up with an onscreen notification when it is time for a task.
In conclusion: Freemind is a reminder app meant to aggressively remind the user, and more aggressively reward them. Your time is worth money, and I think Freemind does a good job adding a slight monetary value to each of your tasks.
