  Hi, my name is Cameron Bates, I'm a student at Columbia College Chicago, majoring in Game Design.

  <h1>Learning 2D animation</h1>
  
  <p>
  I've recently been trying to pick up 2D pixel art, and am starting to get happy with my progress in developing the skill. I like the idea of being able to create
  my own sprites for my games sometimes, so I created this sprite intended for a Fire Emblem-inspired game:
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzmaxus/zzmaxus.github.io/main/Assets/practiceanim.gif">
  </p>
  
  <p>
  This was my second time actively animating a sprite, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. The sprite is intended to be a royal knight attacking, and I actually
  found myself changing things up as I realized more things to add, such as adding more detail to the cape in earlier frames after realizing I should animate it:
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzmaxus/zzmaxus.github.io/main/Assets/yettobenamednobleguy.png">
  (The first draft of the first frame, notice the only part of the cape you can actually see is the underside.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
  And here is the full spritesheet:
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzmaxus/zzmaxus.github.io/main/Assets/yettobenamednobleguy1-Sheet.png">
  After this, I think I've gotten a little better understanding how to use motion blurs in animation. It really helps selling movement, and even doing little things like
  having the cape not be in the exact same place as it was the previous frame can make it look a little more like it's actually moving in response to the character's movement.

  <h1>Inari Level</h1>
  I blocked out a small level for Inari, a game I'm working on at Columbia. The main idea that was decided for the first level is that it would take place at a festival, and have the player defeat the demons around the town.

  At first I kind of wanted to have some non-linearity in the level, but I decided to just have it be a shorter linear level. I got through it kind of quickly, but I think a newer player would take a little longer to get used to how the combat and movement is. Especially the walljump. One thing I would want to do is add a longer rooftop section after the current end of the level.

  <h1>Animation from a spritesheet</h1>
  I recently tried out learning more about using spritesheets to create 2D animations in Unity, and managed to use one pre-made spritesheet to do so. Using this 
  Nightborne Warrior by CreativeKind spritesheet: https://creativekind.itch.io/nightborne-warrior
  I was able to create a few animations to be used in unity.

  Using these sprites I created the animations seen in this video:

  I mainly chose this spritesheet because I thought it'd be interesting to use as inspiration for another idea I have, and would likely give a decent base for that idea.
